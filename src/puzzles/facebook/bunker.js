The Venetians were struck by an amazing sight as they woke up on Tuesday morning: the cityâ€™s famous canals were closed. Because the gondola traffic was stuck, the townspeople could not get to their jobs. Indeed, many spent an extra day skating along the canals.",

    linkDesc: "When NASA astronauts return to the moon in 2024, they'll need a lunar base that allows them to stay on the surface. And the astronauts may build their base using something readily available: their urine. As part of NASA's Artemis program, the first woman and next man on the moon will be landing at the lunar South Pole. It's a place with fluctuating temperatures that will require astronauts to \"learn how to live and operate on the surface of another celestial body\", according to the agency.",
